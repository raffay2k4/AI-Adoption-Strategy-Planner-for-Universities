university settings. By addressing critical gaps in training and infrastructure while proactively managing privacy and bias risks, institutions can harness AI's benefits while preserving academic integrity and ensuring equitable access.\\n\\nThe plan's phased approach allows for careful monitoring and adjustment, ensuring that the unique needs of both South Asian and North American educational contexts are met. Success depends on sustained commitment to ethical AI use, continuous monitoring for bias and privacy issues, and maintaining the delicate balance between AI assistance and the development of fundamental academic skills.\\n\\nThrough careful implementation of this pilot plan, universities can position themselves at the forefront of educational innovation while maintaining their core mission of developing independent, critical thinkers prepared for an AI-augmented future.\"\n",
